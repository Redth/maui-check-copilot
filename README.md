Example repo for experimenting with prompts to effectively replace 'maui-check' with AI

## Prerequisites

1. Install the MauiDevEnv MCP Server dotnet tool: `dotnet tool install --global Mcp.Server.MauiDevEnv`
2. Ensure the `chat.promptFiles` feature is enabled:
3. Open a new Copilot chat (use Copilot Edits and select the _Agent_ mode).
4. Check that the MauiDevEnv MCP server is running and lists its tools
5. Click "Add Context..." in the chat and add a "Prompt", selecting "maui-dev-env.prompt.md"

## Chatting

Now you can ask the chat something like:
